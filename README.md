# Learn new dances, sports, or stretching techniques in a few clicks
Powered by MediaPipe, our website detects, aligns and overlays the user's skeleton onto a training video, giving visual feedback on how accurately the user is mimicking the trainer. You can upload a .mp4 file or select from some pre-loaded videos to start training. A perfect application for fans of yoga, tai-chi, dancing, or any sport where body part positioning is very important.

# How it works
The whole application is implemented in the front-end (so this website can be saved and used offline) using MediaPipe's pose model. The UI and visualization was implemented with React.

# Try it out yourself!
Simply navigate to https://eliedabdo.github.io/CodeJam/ on a webcam-enabled laptop to start training.
